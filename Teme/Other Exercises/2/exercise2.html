            <h1> Birthstones by Day of the Week </h1>

            <p> 
                When it comes to birthstones based on day of the week, </br>
                each day has a planetary ruler in astrology, </br>
                and each of those planets is connected to certain gemstones. </br>
                For example, Monday is ruled by the moon ("moonday!"), </br>
                which is often associated with moonstone. </br>
            </p>
